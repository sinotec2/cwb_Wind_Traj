- get the CWB daily reports by [rd_cwbDay.py](https://github.com/sinotec2/rd_cwbDay.py/blob/main/rd_cwbDay.py)
- generate wind fields using weights which generated by [twn_cwbInverDist.py](https://github.com/sinotec2/cwb_Wind_Traj/blob/master/twn_cwbInverDist.py)
- calculate the trajectory by using [traj2kml.py](https://github.com/sinotec2/cwb_Wind_Traj/blob/master/traj2kml.py)
- may need [csv2kml.py](https://github.com/sinotec2/cwb_Wind_Traj/blob/master/csv2kml.py) to convert the csv file to kml file
